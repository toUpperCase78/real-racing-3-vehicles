**Dataset for All Vehicles in Real Racing 3**

![Real Racing 3](https://i.ibb.co/PtnQjDc/real-racing-3-logo-1.png)

I've been playing this mobile racing game, **Real Racing 3**, developed by EA and Firemonkey, for several years. Although the game is over 6 years old, it still gets many updates throughout each year, which includes vehicles, tracks, career series, special events, exclusive series, motorsport series. Up to now, it contains over 250 vehicles available for purchase and driving.

On the other hand, as I'm eager to apply Data Science nowadays, one day, I asked to myself _"Hey, why don't I create a nice dataset for this game I enjoyed?"_. For this purpose, here, I've created this dataset that lists all the vehicles appeared in the game, also includes discontinued ones. Thus, the dataset is ready for methods to be applied for Data Science and awaits for valuable insights!

All the values in the dataset are obtained from the game's [wiki website](https://rr3.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page).

From time to time, I will keep the dataset up-to-date once new vehicles have been released, along with minor fixes...
